What is Zehef? Zehef is a tool based on the search for **open source** (public) information on an email, whether personal or professional.
For example:
- data leaks
- linked account
- pastebin link dumping
and others...🤯 

With a very simple use you will be able to discover a lot of information that even you may be unaware of.

Zehef can be used as an aid to investigations but also in terms of cyber security.



Have fun 💖!
